# Hangman

In the game, users have to enter letter guesses, and each user will have a limited number of guesses.  

A pre-organized list of words that users can grab words from is created. Also,it includes specific functions to check whether or not a user has entered a single letter or if the input letter is in the hidden word, to if the user has actually inputted a single letter, and to print the correct outcomes.
